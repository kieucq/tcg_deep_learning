#
# NOTE: This machine learning script is for validating TCG prediction, using
#       input dataset in the NETCDF format. The program treats different
#       2D input fields as different channels of an image. This specific
#       program requires a set of 12 2D-variables (12-channel image) and
#       consists of three stages
#       - Stage 1: reading NETCDF input and generating (X,y) data with a
#                  given image sizes, which are then saved by pickle;
#       - Stage 2: import the saved pickle (X,y) pair and build a CNN model
#                  with a given training/validation ratio, and then save
#                  the train model under tcg_CNN.model.
#       - Stage 3: Validation of the model by using the trained model from 
#                  Stage 2, and a list pos/neg input.
#
# INPUT: This Stage 3 script reads in the CNN trained model "tcg_CNN.model"
#        that is generated from Step 2.
#
#        Remarks: Note that the input data for this script must be on the
#        same as in Step 1 with standard 19 vertical
#        levels 1000, 975, 950, 925, 900, 850, 800, 750, 700, 650, 600,
#        550, 500, 450, 400, 350, 300, 250, 200. Also, all field vars must
#        be resize to cover an area of 30x30 around the TC center for the
#        positive data cases.
#        Similar to Step 2, this Step 3 needs to also have a large mem
#        allocation so that it can be run properly.
#
# OUTPUT: A list of probability forecast with the same dimension as the
#        number of input 12-channel images.

# HIST: - 01, Nov 22: Created by CK
#       - 02, Nov 22: Modified to optimize it
#       - 05, Jun 23: Rechecked and added F1 score function for a list of models
#       - 10, Oct 23: Re-worked on the code structure for better flow and future
#                     upgrades with different channels
